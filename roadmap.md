# 2D JRPG + Game Engine: Super Detailed Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Refactoring

### 1.1. **ECS (Entity Component System) Core**
- Research ECS patterns in C++ (EnTT, handmade, etc.).
- Design minimal ECS: Entities (IDs), Components (POD structs), Systems (logic on sets of components).
- Refactor existing Ball/Obstacle/Checkpoint into ECS (Position, Sprite, Collider, etc.).
- Build a basic ECS registry/manager.
- Document ECS API.

### 1.2. **Engine Directory Structure**
- Create `src/engine/` for engine code, `src/game/` for game logic/assets.
- Move reusable systems (collision, rendering, input, audio, resource management) to `engine/`.
- Set up `include/` for engine and game public headers.

### 1.3. **Scene/State Management**
- Implement a `SceneManager` or `StateStack` (push/pop/replace scenes).
- Create basic scenes: MainMenu, WorldMap, Battle, Pause, Dialogue.
- Add transition logic between scenes.

---

## Phase 2: Data-Driven & Tooling

### 2.1. **Data-Driven Content**
- Define data formats for:
  - Maps (start with Tiled `.tmx` or export to JSON).
  - Actors/NPCs (JSON/YAML).
  - Items, skills, monsters, parties (JSON/YAML).
  - Dialogue (Yarn, Ink, or simple JSON/YAML).
- Build data loaders/parsers in `engine/`.
- Support hot-reloading for rapid iteration.

### 2.2. **Tilemap System**
- Integrate Tiled map loader (TMX/JSON).
- Render tilemaps efficiently (batching).
- Support multiple layers, collision masks, tile properties (events, triggers).
- Basic map editor integration (even just hot-reload).

---

## Phase 3: JRPG Core Systems

### 3.1. **Party & Actor System**
- Define Actor/Party components: stats, inventory, skills, status effects.
- Implement party management (add/remove/swap members, inventory use).

### 3.2. **Turn-Based Battle System**
- Design modular battle system (BattleScene).
- Implement turn order logic (ATB/CTB/initiative, can be simple at first).
- Actor/enemy actions: attack, skill, item, defend, run.
- UI: Action menu, target selection, battle log/messages.
- Battle state machine: Start, PlayerTurn, EnemyTurn, Victory, Defeat, Escape, etc.
- Support for status effects, exp/gold/loot rewards.

### 3.3. **Dialogue & Quest System**
- Dialogue scripting (choices, branches, events).
- Simple quest system: track objectives, update on events.
- Integrate with world and battle triggers.

---

## Phase 4: World, Exploration, and UI

### 4.1. **Overworld & Map Navigation**
- Player movement (grid or pixel, map transitions).
- NPC pathing (basic at first, can expand to more complex AI later).
- Map events: triggers for cutscenes, battles, dialogue, etc.
- World <-> Battle transitions.

### 4.2. **UI/UX Layer**
- Build modular UI system: windows, textboxes, menus, buttons.
- Implement inventory, equipment, status, and save/load menus.
- Support gamepad and keyboard navigation.

---

## Phase 5: Engine Features

### 5.1. **Resource Management**
- Texture, audio, font, and data caching.
- Easy asset referencing by name/id.
- Support for asset hot-reload.

### 5.2. **Audio System**
- BGM, SFX, simple audio mixer.
- Music transitions (fade in/out, crossfade).

### 5.3. **Save/Load System**
- Serialize all relevant game state (party, map, flags, quests).
- Design save slots UI.

### 5.4. **Scripting Integration (Advanced)**
- Design for simple scripting (Lua, Squirrel, or even a C++ DSL) for events, dialogue, battle logic.
- Expose engine/game API to scripts.

---

## Phase 6: Polish, Content, Tooling

### 6.1. **Content Creation**
- Build sample maps, enemies, items, skills, and story scenes.
- Test with placeholder art and audio, then iteratively replace.

### 6.2. **Tooling**
- Editor/utility for managing game data (optional, can use external editors at first).
- Debugging tools: in-game console, variable inspection, hot reload for scripts/assets.

### 6.3. **Testing**
- Automated tests for engine subsystems.
- Playtesting scripts for story and battle flows.

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Open Source

- Write developer and modder documentation.
- Comment code and provide sample projects.
- Prepare for open source release (license, contribution guide, issue templates).

## Example Directory Structure

```
/src
  /engine
    ecs/
    render/
    audio/
    input/
    resource/
    scene/
    tilemap/
    ...
  /game
    scenes/
    systems/
    entities/
    data/
    ...
/assets
  /tilesets
  /sprites
  /music
  /sfx
  /maps
  ...
/tests
/include
```

---

## Milestone Breakdown (Suggested Order)

1. ECS core + engine/game separation
2. Scene manager and basic UI
3. Tilemap support and overworld prototype
4. Data-driven content and loaders
5. Basic party and inventory system
6. Turn-based battle system
7. Dialogue/quest system
8. Save/load, audio, and polish

---

## Tips

- **Iterate:** Build vertical slices (overworld → battle → reward → back to map) early and iterate.
- **Reuse:** Look at open-source JRPGs/engines for inspiration, but keep your codebase clean.
- **Modularize:** Keep engine and game logic as separate as possible.
- **Test:** Add automated tests for critical engine features.
- **Document:** Document engine API and game content formats as you go.
